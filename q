# Stacks and Queues. Write a class SQ that defines a data structure that can behave as both a queue (FIFO) or a stack (LIFO), 
# There are five methods that should be implemented:
# 1.	make a constructor with a valid parameter 
# 2.	shift() returns the first element and removes it from the list. Also, use the custom(raise) exception in this method.
# 3.	unshift() "pushes" a new element to the front or head of the list
# 4.	push() adds a new element to the end of a list
# 5.	pop() returns the last element and removes it from the list
# 6.	remove() returns the maximum element of the list and removes it from the list.
# 7.	Create the object and call all methods of the SQ class.
